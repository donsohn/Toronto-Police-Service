# Toronto Police Service - Crime Rate Predictive Analysis

![alt text](https://github.com/donsohn/Toronto-Police-Service/blob/master/wordcloud.png?raw=true)

## Objective:
To create a model that accurately predicts crime while investigating the possible correlation between the prediction, demographics and social services.
The purpose for our model is to assist in crime reduction via effective resource reallocation.

## Approach:
With CRISP-DM as guideline for approach: using 2014-2019 crime data from Toronto Police Service, supplemented with social services and demographics data, perform unsupervised and supervised machine learning.  

Unsupervised learning includes K-Mean and Hierarchical clustering.  

Supervised learning includes linear regression, logistic regression, graident boosting decision tree, K nearet neighbour classifier, Support Vector classification, decision tree classifier, Na√Øve bayes classifier, Random forest classifier, and neural networks.

In addition, made attempts for time series analysis and sentiment analysis (using Twitter API).
